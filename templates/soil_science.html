                <h3>Why Understanding Suitable and Not-Suitable Land is Important</h3>
                <p>Understanding the characteristics of suitable and not-suitable land is crucial for successful farming practices. Suitable land is the foundation for healthy crops, ensuring that plants have access to the necessary nutrients, proper drainage, and optimal growing conditions. On the other hand, not-suitable land may lead to poor crop yields, environmental damage, or wasted resources. By understanding both types of land, farmers can make informed decisions about where to plant, how to improve soil conditions, and how to optimize irrigation and fertilization methods for sustainable agriculture.</p>

<!-- Modal definitions for each type of suitable land (using dynamic loops for less code duplication) -->
{% for modal_id, modal_title, modal_content in [
    ('arableModal', 'Arable Land', 'Arable land is suitable for farming as it is well-drained, has a deep soil profile, and supports plant growth with sufficient nutrients. It is often flat and free of obstructions, making it ideal for cultivation.'),
    ('drainedModal', 'Well-Drained Land', 'Well-drained land has good water movement, preventing waterlogging that could harm plant roots. This type of land is essential for most crops, providing ideal conditions for root growth and nutrient absorption.'),
    ('fertileModal', 'Fertile Land', 'Fertile land is rich in nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It supports the growth of crops by offering essential elements required for plant development. Fertile land often has a balance of organic matter, minerals, and microbial activity.'),
    ('flatModal', 'Flat Land', 'Flat land is ideal for farming because it allows for efficient irrigation, easier planting, and even distribution of water and nutrients. Flat land is less prone to erosion and provides more predictable growing conditions.'),
    ('loamyModal', 'Loamy Soil', 'Loamy soil is considered the best for farming due to its balanced texture. It retains moisture without becoming waterlogged, allows roots to grow freely, and is rich in nutrients. Loam also has excellent aeration, which promotes healthy plant growth.')

    ('waterloggedModal', 'Waterlogged Land', 'Waterlogged land has poor drainage and retains excessive water, making it difficult for plants to grow. The excessive moisture leads to root rot, nutrient deficiencies, and an increased risk of fungal diseases. This type of land is unsuitable for most agricultural crops.'),
    ('steepModal', 'Steep Land', 'Steep land is prone to erosion and runoff, making it difficult to manage for farming. Crops on steep slopes are often exposed to excessive water runoff, which washes away topsoil and reduces soil fertility. Such land is challenging for cultivation and requires special techniques to prevent erosion.'),
    ('sandyModal', 'Sandy Soil', 'Sandy soil has large particles that allow water to drain too quickly, making it difficult for plants to absorb enough water and nutrients. This type of soil often lacks the necessary organic matter and nutrients for healthy plant growth. It also requires frequent irrigation and fertilization.'),
    ('acidicModal', 'Acidic Soil', 'Acidic soil has a low pH, which can affect the availability of essential nutrients for plants. Crops generally prefer neutral to slightly acidic soils, so highly acidic soil can lead to nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, and poor crop yields.')
